## API Key Authentication

All Poof API requests require authentication via an API key. Include your key in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.poof.bg/v1/remove \
  -H "x-api-key: poof_your_api_key" \
  -F "image_file=@photo.jpg"
```

## Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign In">
    Go to [dash.poof.bg](https://dash.poof.bg) and log in to your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Click on **API Keys** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create or Copy">
    Copy your existing key or create a new one. Keys start with `poof_`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
**Never expose your API key in client-side code.** Anyone with your key can make requests on your behalf and consume your credits.
</Warning>

### Do's and Don'ts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="✅ Do" icon="check">
    - Store keys in environment variables
    - Use server-side code for API calls
    - Rotate keys periodically
    - Use separate keys for dev/prod
  </Card>
  <Card title="❌ Don't" icon="xmark">
    - Commit keys to version control
    - Include keys in frontend JavaScript
    - Share keys in public channels
    - Use production keys for testing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Environment Variables

Store your API key in an environment variable:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux/macOS">
    ```bash
    export POOF_API_KEY="poof_your_api_key"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    $env:POOF_API_KEY = "poof_your_api_key"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title=".env file">
    ```bash
    # .env (add to .gitignore!)
    POOF_API_KEY=poof_your_api_key
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then use it in your code:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import os
from poof import Poof

client = Poof(api_key=os.environ["POOF_API_KEY"])
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Poof } from '@poof-bg/sdk';

const poof = new Poof({ 
  apiKey: process.env.POOF_API_KEY 
});
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.poof.bg/v1/remove \
  -H "x-api-key: $POOF_API_KEY" \
  -F "image_file=@photo.jpg"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Key Management

### Multiple Keys

You can create multiple API keys for different purposes:

| Key Name | Environment | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `poof_dev_...` | Development | Local testing |
| `poof_staging_...` | Staging | Pre-production testing |
| `poof_prod_...` | Production | Live application |

### Rotating Keys

To rotate a key without downtime:

1. Create a new key in the dashboard
2. Update your application to use the new key
3. Deploy the change
4. Delete the old key

### Revoking Keys

If a key is compromised:

1. Go to [dash.poof.bg](https://dash.poof.bg)
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click **Revoke** immediately
4. Create a new key and update your application

<Note>
Revoked keys stop working immediately. Make sure you have a new key ready before revoking the old one in production.
</Note>

## Rate Limits

API keys are subject to rate limits based on your plan:

| Plan | Requests/minute |
|------|-----------------|
| Free | 10 |
| Pro | 100 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

When you exceed the limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. See [Error Handling](/errors) for details.
