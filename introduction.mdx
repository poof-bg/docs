curl -X POST https://api.poof.bg/v1/remove \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "image_file=@photo.jpg" \
  -o result.png
```

```python Python
from poofbg import Poof

client = Poof(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
result = client.remove("photo.jpg")
result.save("result.png")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Poof } from '@poof-bg/js';

const poof = new Poof({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
const result = await poof.removeBackground(imageFile);
```
