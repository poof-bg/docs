## Example Workflows

### E-commerce Product Photos

Automatically process product images from a folder:

```
Read Binary Files → Poof (Remove BG) → Write Binary Files
```

1. **Read Binary Files**: Watch a folder for new images
2. **Poof**: Remove background, output as PNG
3. **Write Binary Files**: Save to processed folder

### API Endpoint

Create an API that removes backgrounds on demand:

```
Webhook → Poof (Remove BG) → Respond to Webhook
```

1. **Webhook**: Accept POST with image
2. **Poof**: Process the image
3. **Respond**: Return processed image

### Bulk Processing with Spreadsheet

Process images listed in a Google Sheet:

```
Google Sheets → HTTP Request → Poof → Google Drive
```

1. **Google Sheets**: Read rows with image URLs
2. **HTTP Request**: Download each image
3. **Poof**: Remove backgrounds
4. **Google Drive**: Upload results

### Airtable Integration

Process images attached to Airtable records:

```
Airtable Trigger → HTTP Request → Poof → Airtable Update
```

1. **Airtable Trigger**: When record created/updated
2. **HTTP Request**: Download attachment
3. **Poof**: Remove background
4. **Airtable Update**: Add processed image to record

## Working with Binary Data

The Poof node outputs binary data. To use it:

### Save to File
```
Poof → Write Binary File
```

### Upload to Cloud
```
Poof → S3 / Google Drive / Dropbox
```

### Return via API
```
Poof → Respond to Webhook (Binary)
```

### Convert to Base64
```
Poof → Move Binary Data (to JSON)
```

## Error Handling

Add an **Error Trigger** node to handle failures:

```
Poof ──┬── (success) → Continue
       └── (error) → Error Trigger → Slack/Email notification
```

Common errors:
- `401` — Check your API credentials
- `402` — Out of credits
- `429` — Rate limited, add a Wait node

## Rate Limiting

If processing many images, add delays to avoid rate limits:

```
Split In Batches (batch size: 5) → Poof → Wait (1 second)
```

## Check Account Balance

Use the **Get Account** operation to check credits before processing:

```
Poof (Get Account) → IF (credits > 100) → Process Images
                           └── (else) → Alert Low Credits
```

## Tips

<Tip>
**Use Preview size for testing** — It's faster and uses fewer credits while you're building your workflow.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Set up error notifications** — Connect failed executions to Slack or email so you know when something goes wrong.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Batch your operations** — Process images in groups of 5-10 with delays to avoid rate limits.
