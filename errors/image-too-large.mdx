title: Image Too Large
description: "Image exceeds size limit"
---

**HTTP Status:** 400

```json
{
  "code": "image_too_large",
  "message": "The uploaded image exceeds the maximum size",
  "details": "Maximum file size is 20MB",
  "request_id": "req_abc123"
}
```

## Reasons and How to Fix

### File Size Exceeds 20MB

The maximum allowed file size is 20MB.

**To fix:**
1. Compress the image before uploading
2. Resize to smaller dimensions
3. Use a more efficient format (JPEG instead of PNG for photos)

### Image Compression Tips

```python
from PIL import Image

# Resize large images
img = Image.open("large_photo.jpg")
img.thumbnail((4096, 4096))  # Max 4096px on longest side
img.save("resized.jpg", quality=85)
```

```bash
# Using ImageMagick
convert large_photo.jpg -resize 4096x4096\> -quality 85 resized.jpg
```

### Recommended Dimensions

For best results, images don't need to be huge:

| Use Case | Recommended Size |
|----------|-----------------|
| Web thumbnails | 800×800 |
| E-commerce | 2000×2000 |
| Print quality | 4000×4000 |
