title: Authentication Error
description: "Invalid or missing API key"
---

**HTTP Status:** 401

```json
{
  "code": "authentication_error",
  "message": "Invalid or missing API key",
  "details": "Check your 'x-api-key' header",
  "request_id": "req_abc123"
}
```

## Reasons and How to Fix

### Missing API Key Header

The most common cause is forgetting to include the `x-api-key` header in your request.

```bash
# ❌ Wrong - missing header
curl -X POST https://api.poof.bg/v1/remove -F "image_file=@photo.jpg"

# ✅ Correct
curl -X POST https://api.poof.bg/v1/remove \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "image_file=@photo.jpg"
```

### Invalid API Key

Your API key may be incorrect or malformed. API keys start with `pk_` for production keys.

**To fix:**
1. Go to [dash.poof.bg](https://dash.poof.bg) and copy your API key
2. Ensure you're using the full key without extra spaces
3. Check that you haven't accidentally included quotes around the key

### Expired or Revoked Key

If your key was recently regenerated or revoked, old keys will no longer work.

**To fix:**
1. Log into [dash.poof.bg](https://dash.poof.bg)
2. Generate a new API key if needed
3. Update your application with the new key
