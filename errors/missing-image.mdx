title: Missing Image
description: "No image file in request"
---

**HTTP Status:** 400

```json
{
  "code": "missing_image",
  "message": "The request did not contain an image file",
  "details": "Ensure you are sending multipart/form-data with field 'image_file'",
  "request_id": "req_abc123"
}
```

## Reasons and How to Fix

### No Image File Provided

The `/remove` endpoint requires an image file in the `image_file` field.

```bash
# ❌ Wrong - no image
curl -X POST https://api.poof.bg/v1/remove \
  -H "x-api-key: KEY"

# ✅ Correct
curl -X POST https://api.poof.bg/v1/remove \
  -H "x-api-key: KEY" \
  -F "image_file=@photo.jpg"
```

### Wrong Content-Type

The request must use `multipart/form-data` encoding.

```bash
# ❌ Wrong - JSON body
curl -X POST https://api.poof.bg/v1/remove \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"image": "..."}'

# ✅ Correct - multipart/form-data
curl -X POST https://api.poof.bg/v1/remove \
  -H "x-api-key: KEY" \
  -F "image_file=@photo.jpg"
```

### Wrong Field Name

The field must be named exactly `image_file`.

```bash
# ❌ Wrong field name
-F "image=@photo.jpg"
-F "file=@photo.jpg"

# ✅ Correct
-F "image_file=@photo.jpg"
```
