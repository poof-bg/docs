title: Rate Limit Exceeded
description: "Too many requests"
---

**HTTP Status:** 429

```json
{
  "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "details": "Implement exponential backoff and retry",
  "request_id": "req_abc123"
}
```

## Reasons and How to Fix

### Too Many Requests

You're sending requests faster than your plan allows.

**To fix:**
1. Implement exponential backoff in your code
2. Add delays between requests
3. Consider upgrading to a higher plan for increased rate limits

### Burst Limit Hit

Even with credits available, there's a per-second burst limit to ensure service stability.

**Best Practices:**

```python
import time
import random

def call_with_backoff(func, max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except RateLimitError:
            wait = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
            time.sleep(wait)
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

```typescript
async function callWithBackoff(fn: () => Promise<any>, maxRetries = 5) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (e) {
      if (e.code !== 'rate_limit_exceeded') throw e;
      const wait = Math.pow(2, attempt) + Math.random();
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, wait * 1000));
    }
  }
  throw new Error('Max retries exceeded');
}
```

## Rate Limits by Plan

| Plan | Requests/second | Requests/day |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Free | 1 | 100 |
| Pro | 10 | 10,000 |
| Business | 50 | 100,000 |
